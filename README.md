We are students of software engineering at [University of Brasilia](https://www.unb.br)(UnB-FGA) studying programming paradigms with our teacher advisor [Milene Serrano](@mileneserrano).

# Project 1
Project in Haskell 

This project resulted in the development of a Game Boy-inspired console game.
The Game Boy is an 8-bit handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo.

There are 4 games in the project:

* Tic-Tac-Toe game :o: :x:
* Rock paper and scissors :facepunch: :hand: :v:
* Hangman game :walking:
* Guess the number :interrobang:

To play them, you need to install the game module. Here are the steps to intall and start the game:

### For Linux Distribution :penguin: :

1)You must [clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the game repository. To clone go to the terminal and type:
~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/paradigmas-2019-2-malufa/projeto-1.git
~~~

2)Enter the repository folder
~~~
$cd projeto-1
~~~

3)You have to install the Haskell Platform. The game alredy have [dependencises](https://github.com/paradigmas-2019-2-malufa/projeto-1/blob/master/install_dependencies.sh) so you just need to type:
~~~
$./install_dependencies.sh
~~~

4)To compile the game, type:
~~~
$./compile
~~~

5)To run the game, type:
~~~
$./minigames.out
~~~

6)After all these steps, just enjoy the game. Have fun!
